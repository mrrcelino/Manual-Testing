# Manual-Testing
This repository contains Manual testing projects I've made. This project are include test cases, scenarios, reports, and test metrics for manual testing projects. It serves as a comprehensive resource for manual testers to effectively plan, execute, and track their testing efforts.

## Test Cases
The test-cases directory contains a collection of test cases written for different features or modules of the system under test. Each test case should include the following information:

- Test case ID
- Test case description
- Pre-requisites
- Test steps
- Expected results
- Actual results (to be filled during test execution)

Test cases are essential for ensuring thorough test coverage and providing a clear roadmap for manual testing.
